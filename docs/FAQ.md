# Usage Issues

## How to manage certificates?

ACME method (recommended) The system automatically manages. The self-owned certificate method requires manual maintenance and manual replacement after expiration

## How to set the Hysteria2 certificate path for your own certificate?

Upload the certificate file to the server. When configuring Hysteria2, fill in the absolute path of the certificate. When deploying through Docker, you need to upload the certificate file to the volume mapping folder. Recommended: /h-ui/bin

Hysteria2 with lower versions does not support the latest API

## Log export failed
